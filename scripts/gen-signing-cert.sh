# gen-signing-cert.sh: generate a STABLE self-signed code-signing certificate
# for Paperly's macOS builds (no Apple Developer Program).
#
# Why: an ad-hoc signed app gets a new code identity (cdhash) on every build,
# so macOS TCC re-asks for every permission after each auto-update. Signing
# with the SAME self-signed cert on every release gives a stable "designated
# requirement" (identifier + leaf certificate), so TCC recognizes the updated
# app as the same app and keeps the permissions you already granted.
#
# This does NOT notarize. Gatekeeper will still show the "unidentified
# developer" warning on first install (the `xattr -cr` step stays). Only an
# Apple Developer ID + notarization removes that.
#
# Run ONCE. Re-running with --force regenerates the cert, which RESETS every
# permission grant (new leaf certificate => new designated requirement). Keep
# the generated .p12 safe; it is the only copy of the signing key.
#
# Output goes to ~/.paperly-signing/ (outside the repo, never committed).
# After running, follow the printed `gh secret set` commands.
